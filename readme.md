# Runzip


## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rickard-Martensson/runzip.git

```
2. Navigate to the `runzip` folder

```bash
cd runzip
```

3. Make script executable

```bash
chmod +x runzip.py
```

## Setup
Create a symlink to make runzip accessible from any directory:

```bash
sudo ln -s /path/to/your/runzip/runzip.py /usr/local/bin/runzip
```

Replace `/path/to/your/runzip.py` with the actual path where you have `runzip.py`.

For me, that is `/home/rickard/Code/python/runzip/runzip.py`

## Dependencies

Before using the `runzip.py` script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your Arch Linux system:

- `unzip`: For extracting ZIP files.
- `tar`: For extracting TAR files.
- `gzip`: For decompressing GZ files.

You can install these dependencies using the `pacman` package manager. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S unzip tar gzip
```

## Usage

To unzip a file, simply type


```bash
runzip <filename>
```

If you want to test it out, you can use any of the 4 sample files. ie:
```bash
runzip sample_zipped/sample.tar.bz2
```
Good luck!

## Supported File Types
- .zip
- .tar
- .gz
- .tar.bz2
